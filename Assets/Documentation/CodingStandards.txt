Naming:

    Methods: Each method, for example:

        public void thisIsAMethod(string pVariable) {

        }

      Should be named in camelCase. Which means that the first letter is lower case, but each word after that starts with an upper case.
        The name should reflect what the method does.

    Variables: Variables should be in camelCase. 
	If it is a temporary variable for a method, use a "p" in front of it, such as "pVariable"
        This will show that it is not class wide. The p stands for parameter. The name should reflect the purpose of the variable.
	If the variable is private put and "_" in front of it. For example:

		private string _thisIsAPrivateVariable;
		private int _myInteger;
		
		public int myPublicInteger;
		public string myString;

Conventions:

    Methods: When a piece of code is used more that once, put it in a method so that we reduce the use of duplicate code.
        The more universal you can make the method, the better.
        Use private methods unless the method needs to be accessed by another script.

    Variables: Limit public variables to those that need to be accessed by the editor.
        You can create a public method for setting the variable as well as getting the variable, for example:

            public int getVariable() {
                return variable;
            }

            public void setVariable(int pVariable) {
                variable = pVariable;
            }

        This will help protect the variables and clean up the code.
